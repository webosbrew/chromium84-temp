# This file shows a very simple way to create a tarball (tar.gz) with a few
# essential files including the Chromium binary, in which a regular user will
# be able to play around with Chromium Wayland Browser.
#
# IMPORTANT: by no means this is a definitive solution for packaging Chromium
# Wayland Browser in your distribution. Please refer to this link for more

# TODO(vignatti): build a python script and automate the instructions mentioned
# below.

first I've made sure everything inside src/out/Release/ concerns Chromium only,
i.e. only chrome target was compiled and nothing else before.

$ cd src/out/

$ mkdir chromium-wayland/

$ rsync -a -v --exclude=content_shell* --exclude=gen --exclude=obj Release/ chromium-wayland/

$ tar czvf chromium-wayland.tar.gz chromium-wayland/
