To run neva's 'platoform bus emulator server' (emulator server
for short) just run the run_emulator_server.bash script to start
and preconfigure MockServer[1] and to start TestsServer as well.

MockServer is supposed to provide emulated answers that it
was told to and also serves as a http-frontend to TestsServer.
TestsServer in turn is basically serves static http emulator pages
and their js scripts which actually are neva emulator clients.

By default, MockServer is configured to serve on tcp/8888 port
and TestsServer is on tcp/8887 port. Thus, to run emulator client
page just open http://localhost:8888 in your browser.
